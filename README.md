## The problem.
Learning Python involves **actually** doing things practically, sitting down and watching YouTube tutorial after another won't get you anywhere. Beginners tend to fall into this, we even have a name for it, it's called Tutorial 🔥 Hell. Tutorials are good for getting to know the basics but I believe that's where you should stop and begin actually writing code. #

🐍 Snakelings helps with 🌟 that. 🐍 Snakelings provides a set of short exercises to immerse you into developing and debugging Python code. Inspired by [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings), each exercise in Snakelings has intentional faults designed to expose you to a range of Python exceptions / errors. 🐍 Snakelings bridges the gap between theoretical and actual coding knowledge by providing a **real** environment.
